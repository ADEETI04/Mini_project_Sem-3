# Advanced Inventory Demand Forecasting

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based solution for inventory demand forecasting. It uses an ensemble of models including LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Prophet to predict future inventory demands with high accuracy.

## Features
- Multiple model ensemble approach
- Advanced feature engineering
- Real-time monitoring and drift detection
- Automated report generation
- Comprehensive visualization suite
- Model performance tracking

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ADEETI04/Mini_project_Sem-3.git
cd inventory_forecasting
